## What is reported
The different reports are generated by python modules in `git_inspector/reports`.
So far the following reports are generated:
* `dirty.py` reports repositories with a **dirty working directory**
* `merged.py` reports branches, that are **merged** into the *master* **branch** and can be safely deleted
* `unpushed.py` reports branches, that contain **un-pushed** commits
* `untrached_branches.py` reports branches, that have **no upstream** and exist only locally
* `broken_remote.py` reports local remotes of which the remote directory does not exist  
* `untracked.py` reports branches, that are **not tracked** by a remote branch

## Installation

##### 1. Install with pip over https
```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/yaniksoeltzer/git_inspector

```

You can use `git_inspector` and `git-inspector` in like manner.
For help about the usage run `git-inspector --help`.

### Directory `[path ...]`

Provide one or multiple relative or absolute `paths` to the Git-Inspector.
```bash
# Inspect the home directory of the current user
git_inspector ~

# Inspect current directory
git_inspector .

# Inspect multiple directories
git_inspector ~/my_projects /opt/projects
```



### Report Level `[--report-level]`
The Git-Inspector allows to set the report level, showing only reports with the provided report-level or 
a higher report-level. The report-level can be set to `alert`, `warning`, or `hint` using the `--report-level` / `-l` parameter.
The default value is `warning`.
To also show hints run 
```bash
# Show everything
git_inspector -l hints

# Show only alerts and warnings
git_inspector -l warnings

# Show only alerts
git_inspector -l alerts
```
